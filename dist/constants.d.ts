/**
 * Hydration marker protocol — the single source of truth shared by the server
 * emit (the `octane/compiler` compiler's server mode) and the client `hydrate`
 * runtime. The server writes these comment markers into the HTML it produces and
 * the client hydration cursor scans for them to align with the server output, so
 * BOTH sides must use byte-identical strings or hydration fails.
 *
 * Values follow the Svelte/Ripple convention (`[` open, `]` close) so the
 * protocol is familiar and the marker comments are compact.
 *
 * The server emit (runtime.server `ssrBlock` and friends) writes these markers
 * around every dynamic site, and the client `hydrateRoot` cursor scans for them
 * to align with the server output. This module is the public home both import;
 * the marker payloads and boundary attribute names themselves are declared in
 * `hydration-markers.js`, which stays off the `dom-tables.js` graph so the
 * pre-root capture bundle can share them, and are re-exported here unchanged.
