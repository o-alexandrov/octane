/**
 * octane runtime — template-clone renderer with React-shape state model.
 *
 * Architecture overview: see /README.md (project positioning + `.tsrx` syntax) and
 * the section headers throughout this file — the comments here are the design spec.
 *
 * Block = mount/unmount boundary (Root / control-flow / dynamic / portal).
 * Scope = per-call-site hook bag inside a Block.
 * Hooks key by compile-time Symbol per call site (conditional-safe).
 * State: React-shape immutable values + setters that schedule the enclosing Block.
 * Updates: microtask-flushed queue with automatic batching.
 * Effects: three-phase pipeline (insertion sync → layout sync → passive post-paint).
 * Reconciliation: LIS-based keyed list inside forBlock (ported from Ripple's patchKeyedChildrenComplex).
